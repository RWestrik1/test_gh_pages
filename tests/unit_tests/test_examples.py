"""This file contains example unit tests. 
A unit test is a test of a smallest unit of work. For example, one function.
Make sure that all unit tests are light-weight.
Make sure that all unit tests assert that the outcome of a function is as expected.
Do not make connections to databases or any outside sources (ie networking components)."""
